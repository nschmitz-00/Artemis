/**
 * Everything the milestone assessment page needs for one student, in one request: the group-level information its first
 * tab shows, and the stories its remaining tabs grade.
 * <p>
 * The milestone's own result is what carries the group's static code analysis feedback - the fan-out deliberately copies
 * only test case feedback down to the stories, and every story has static code analysis switched off, so this is the
 * only place those issues exist. It is sent as an ordinary {@link ResultDTO} so the client can reuse the same component
 * the student-facing group page renders them with.
 *
 * @param milestoneExerciseId          the group's anchor milestone exercise
 * @param milestoneTitle               its title
 * @param problemStatement             the milestone's problem statement, which is the brief the shared repository was
 *                                         written against; {@code null} when the instructor left it empty
 * @param staticCodeAnalysisEnabled    whether static code analysis runs for this group at all
 * @param maxStaticCodeAnalysisPenalty the cap on the penalty, as a percentage of the milestone's points, or {@code null}
 *                                         when the instructor set none
 * @param milestoneMaxPoints           the milestone's points, which the server keeps equal to the sum of the stories'
 *                                         and which the penalty cap is a percentage of
 * @param milestoneResult              the student's latest milestone result with its synthesized static code analysis
 *                                         feedback, or {@code null} before their first build
 * @param stories                      the group's user stories in a stable order, one tab each
