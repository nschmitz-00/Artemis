/**
 * Aggregates a {@link MilestoneExerciseGroup}'s points onto its anchor {@link MilestoneExercise}, which is the only
 * exercise of the group that counts towards a student's score:
 *
 * <pre>
 * milestone points = sum(points achieved on each UserStoryExercise) - static code analysis penalty
 * </pre>
 *
 * and {@code 0} outright if the shared codebase violates a {@link CategoryState#BLOCKING} category.
 * <p>
 * <b>Why the penalty is applied here and nowhere else.</b> Every user story of a group shares one repository and one CI
 * build, so a static code analysis violation belongs to the group's codebase rather than to any one story. Charging it
 * per story would charge it once per story. The build's SCA feedback therefore stays on the milestone result (the
 * fan-out in {@code ProgrammingExerciseGradingService} deliberately does not copy it down), it is priced exactly once by
 * the ordinary grading path against the milestone's {@code maxPoints} - which {@code MilestoneExerciseService} keeps
 * equal to the sum of the group's story points - and this service subtracts it once from the aggregate.
 * <p>
 * <b>Consistency.</b> This is deliberately a recomputation from current state rather than an incremental update, which
 * makes it idempotent and safe to run concurrently with itself or with a fan-out that is still writing story results.
 * A run that observes a half-written fan-out produces a transiently wrong value; every story result write schedules
 * another run (see {@code MilestoneScoreScheduleService}), so the value converges on the last write. This is the same
 * eventual-consistency contract participant scores already have.
