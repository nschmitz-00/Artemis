 * mounts the assessment editor of its exercise type; a quiz is graded automatically and only shows its score.
 * <p>
 * Only the active exercise's assessment editor is mounted at a time, and that is a hard constraint rather than a
 * preference: `DomainService` is `providedIn: 'root'` and holds a single global domain, so two live editors would
 * fight over which repository the code editor is pointed at. Switching tabs therefore tears the previous editor down,
 * which is also why a switch has to be refused while it holds unsaved feedback.
 * <p>
 * The milestone and the student are named in the course title bar. A tutor must never be in doubt whose work is on screen -
 * unlike every other assessment page, this one is reached by choosing a person rather than by being handed a
 * submission.
